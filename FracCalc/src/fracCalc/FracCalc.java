/* Outline!!!
 * Input value -- 
 * 	- One string
 *  - New values separated by a single space (Look for spaces!!)
 * Organization
 *  - (note to self -- call everything within produce answer to keep values within scope)
 *  - method produceAnswer handles all calculations
 *  - main method handles all the output and user interface -- handles quit function as well
 *  - Helper methods as needed for organization -- Listed here:
 * Main method!
 *  - Create scanner userBoi
 *  - while loop to check if userBoi = "quit"
 *  	- "quit" exits the loop
 *  - userBoi != "quit", go on
 * produceAnswer method!
 *  - SPECIAL CONDITIONS TO REMEMEBORIO 
 *  	- Divide by 0
 *  	- Multiply by 0
 *  	-
